Proposal:
The company currently operates with a diverse desktop footprint, consisting of 85 desktops running Windows OS and 45 running macOS. Employees in design and publishing primarily utilize macOS due to its compatibility with industry-standard software, while administrative, marketing, and general office staff rely on Windows systems for productivity and business applications. To maintain system performance, it is essential to upgrade desktops that do not meet the latest OS requirements, ensuring compatibility with modern applications and security standards.
A hybrid operating system approach is recommended to optimize efficiency across different departments. Windows should continue to be the primary OS for administrative, marketing, and general office roles due to its strong support for business applications and enterprise tools. macOS should remain the standard for creative professionals who rely on software such as Adobe Creative Suite and other design tools. Additionally, introducing Linux as an option for employees who require a lightweight, customizable OS can provide cost-effective flexibility without compromising performance. This diversified OS strategy will allow the company to maximize productivity while catering to the unique needs of each department.
The IT infrastructure should remain primarily on-premise to maintain control over system security and data management. However, integrating cloud-based services for software distribution, data backup, and remote collaboration will enhance overall efficiency and disaster recovery capabilities. This hybrid model ensures that critical business operations remain secure while leveraging the benefits of cloud technology for scalability and accessibility.
This strategy is justified by several key factors. Maintaining the existing OS types ensures compatibility with current workflows, minimizing disruptions and reducing the learning curve for employees. macOS is essential for design professionals, while Windows remains the preferred choice for general office productivity. Implementing a hybrid approach also prevents unnecessary costs associated with software licenses, hardware replacements, and additional training. From a security and maintenance perspective, proper patch management, antivirus protection, and regular system updates will be crucial in safeguarding company data and maintaining system reliability.
By implementing this approach, the company can enhance operational efficiency while providing employees with the tools and systems best suited for their specific roles. This balance between functionality, cost-effectiveness, and security will ensure a sustainable and scalable IT infrastructure.
